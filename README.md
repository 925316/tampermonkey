# Enhanced Web Experience

This repository consolidates a set of handy JavaScript userscripts designed to streamline and personalize your browsing across several popular sites. Whether you want a distraction-free AI interface, one-key Douyin blocking, or seamless Youdao translations without redirects, these scripts have you covered.

## Script Overview

- **AI FullScreen**  
  Light adjustments to page CSS so selected AI platforms expand perfectly to the edges of your screen.

- **Douyin Quick Block**  
  Press the “Q” key on any Douyin web-page video to trigger a fully automated blocking process in the background. The blocking tab closes itself once complete. (Web version only.)

- **Youdao No-Redirect**  
  Removes Youdao’s annoying three-attempt AI translation trial and displays results directly on the same page, avoiding any unwanted navigation.
